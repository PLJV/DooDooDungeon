# Guff
This guff is a repository for odds-and-ends BASH scripts that don't have a home in a full project yet. These shouldn't exist and we should be using Python for most of this work -- but we don't. Let's keep this as tidy as we can, and on AWS or other instances we can mirror this archive and call our server tasks as needed with minimal fuss.
