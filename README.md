This guff is a repository for odds-and-ends legacy BASH scripts that don't have a home in a full project yet. Let's keep this as tidy as we can, and on AWS or other instances we can mirror this archive and call our server tasks as needed with minimal fuss. Slowly, we will begin porting our infrastructure over to Python and phase the legacy code out of production.
